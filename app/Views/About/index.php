          <p class="lead mt-3">
          I am a graduate at Indiana University Indianapolis with a bachelor's degree in Media Arts & Science (Specialization in Web Design and Development). During my time at IU Indianapolis, I have developed the ability to use coding tools such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and Vue. The process of coding captivates me because of how it constantly teaches me new ways to solve the same issue. I always enjoy learning about the various ways to develop code as it enhances growth in my coding ability each day. Even though I strongly value the concept of individual growth, I am equally passionate about collaborating with fellow coders! A team-oriented coding project induces collective brainstorming, mutual assistance with coding errors, and builds strong connections with our peers.
